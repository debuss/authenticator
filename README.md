## About

A simple yet useful MFA (2-Step Verification) token generator for your desktop.

Available on Windows, Mac OSx and Linux so you do not need to grab your phone and check Google Authenticator anymore, just *copy/paste* it from Authenticator.

## How does it work ?

For now there is no QR Code reader option so you only need to give the name and secret of the application using MFA, and click on the **Add** button.

Done !

Beside, you can also organize your token or delete them.

## Downloads

Source code can be forked and optimized, MIT license is here for that.
